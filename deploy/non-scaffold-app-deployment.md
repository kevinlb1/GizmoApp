# Non-Scaffold App Deployment

This file explains how to deploy and maintain apps on `vickrey10.cs.ubc.ca`
that do **not** use the GizmoApp scaffold.

Examples:

- `AI100` and any other existing app with its own repo, runtime, or service layout
- legacy apps that already existed before the GizmoApp deployment automation
- apps that should still be served under `http://vickrey10.cs.ubc.ca/<name>/`
  but do not have `scripts/install_deployment_instance.sh`

## Rule Of Thumb

- Use GizmoApp automation only for GizmoApp-derived apps.
- Use the neutral nginx host file for **all** path-based routing.
- For non-scaffold apps, manage the app runtime however that app requires, but
  add one explicit nginx snippet for its `/<name>/` route.

## Current Host Layout

The intended nginx structure on `vickrey10.cs.ubc.ca` is:

- host config:
  - `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vickrey10`
  - `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vickrey10`
- per-app snippets:
  - `/etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/AI100.conf`
  - `/etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/gizmotest.conf`
  - `/etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/<future-app>.conf`

The file `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/vickrey10` should include:

```nginx
include /etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/*.conf;
```

This keeps one host-level server block and one snippet per routed app.

## How To Add A Non-Scaffold App

Suppose a non-scaffold app should be served at:

```text
http://vickrey10.cs.ubc.ca/myapp/
```

and its application server listens on `127.0.0.1:8123`.

Create:

```text
/etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/myapp.conf
```

with contents like:

```nginx
location = /myapp {
    return 302 /myapp/;
}

location /myapp/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8123;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /myapp;
    proxy_redirect off;
}
```

Then run:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Then verify:

```bash
curl -sS -D - http://vickrey10.cs.ubc.ca/myapp/ -o /dev/null
```

Use `GET`, not `HEAD`, when validating older apps. Some apps may respond
correctly to browser `GET` requests while still returning `404` for `HEAD`.

## How To Maintain A Non-Scaffold App

GizmoApp scripts do **not** manage these concerns for non-scaffold apps:

- cloning/updating the repo
- creating the Python or Node environment
- creating the service
- choosing the port
- reloading the app after deploy
- app-specific cron or database setup

Those steps stay app-specific.

What nginx should own:

- the public `/<name>/` route
- path-prefix forwarding headers
- optional redirect from `/<name>` to `/<name>/`

## AI100

`AI100` is the current example of a non-scaffold app.

Important facts:

- It is not managed by GizmoApp install scripts.
- It has its own repo and runtime behavior.
- Its route is currently preserved directly in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/vickrey10`.

Until AI100 gets its own explicit managed snippet, treat it as a manually managed
exception. Do not assume it has:

- a generated nginx snippet under `~/bin/AI100/var/generated/`
- GizmoApp-compatible `.env` keys
- GizmoApp-compatible service names

If AI100 is later normalized into the per-app snippet directory, move only its
nginx route there. Do not assume the rest of its deployment should use the
GizmoApp scaffold.

## Recommendation For Future Apps

For any app that is not derived from GizmoApp:

1. Deploy and operate the app using that app's own repo/runtime/service model.
2. Give it one dedicated nginx snippet in `/etc/nginx/gizmoapp-instances/`.
3. Keep the host-level file neutral and unchanged.

That keeps nginx understandable even when the underlying apps are heterogeneous.
